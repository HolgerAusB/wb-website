### Happy new year everyone üéâ

For that first release of that (hopefully) better year than 2020, we have fixed some bugs.

We've also added a new command to clean downloaded images (for those who have enabled download images locally). You can try it to see how much spaces it'll free:

```sh
php bin/console wallabag:clean-downloaded-images --env=prod --dry-run
```

To update your instance, [just run `make update`.](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/admin/upgrade.html#upgrading-from-23x-to-23y)
