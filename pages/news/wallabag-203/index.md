It's time to update! We just released **wallabag 2.0.3**. No more changes, no more fixes, we only forgot one file in wallabag 2.0.2. And you may encounter `Fatal error: Out of memory` error during installation. 

## Changelog

### Added

- [#1962](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/pull/1962) cURL examples in documentation about API (Dirk Deimeke)
