Last year, @j0k3r opened ["Upcoming wallabag version 3.0.0 & 2.6.0"](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/discussions/6177).

🚀 Since this discussion, we released 2.6.0 (and patches). These releases contains fixes and lots of technical stuff to go forward with our stack (Symfony 4.4). Thank you @yguedidi.

About 3.0.0, nothing has changed. You can read again what we decided here [https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/discussions/6177](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/discussions/6177).

Because wallabag 3.0.0 will be released when it will be ready (in wallabag team, there is no pressure and no releases calendar), we added a new milestone: 2.7.0.

This release will contain lots of new features. You can [have a look here](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/milestone/79?closed=1) to see those already implemented.

👉 To avoid upgrade issues (as we had with 2.6.0), **we'll publish beta releases in coming weeks**.
I hope that the great wallabag community will help us to test this new version 😊

We also try to update a large part of the translations: I will publish an announcement on weblate ([https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/wallabag/](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/wallabag/)). If you want to fix or improve your language in wallabag, don't hesitate to join us 🫶

We accept contributions (fixes and new features, translations, websites configuration, and so on) so contact us if you have ideas ❤️

As I said before, no pressure in our team. But I would like to publish wallabag 2.7.0 before the end of the year 🤞
