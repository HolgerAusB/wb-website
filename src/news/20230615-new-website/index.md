Hello!

We want to give you some news about wallabag ecosystem.

## Website üöÄ

As you can see (no!), we now have a new website.

It's the same website (same design and same content). But [it's now open source](https://github.com/wallabag/website) and you can help us to improve it.
It's powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The RSS feed is now available at [wallabag.org/feed.xml](https://wallabag.org/feed.xml) and the old URL redirects to the new one (a RSS link will be soon available).

I want to thank [Johan](https://github.com/jBleuzen) for his work on this website ‚ù§Ô∏è

## wallabag 2.6.0 ‚è∞

The next wallabag release will be 2.6.0 and will be released in the next weeks.

We worked [on things under the hood and some new great features](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/milestone/69).

Before releasing it, we want to launch a call üì£ to our translators team: please have a look [to the weblate dashboard](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/wallabag/#languages) and check if you can translate some missing strings.

## Looking for volunteers ‚ù§Ô∏è

As you know, maintaining a project like wallabag is a lot of work.

That's why we are always looking for volunteers to help us to develop it: translations, third-party apps, documentation, etc.

You can also contribute by fixing configuration files for each website which is not well parsed by our application.

[Have a look on GitHub](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Site+Config%22) and [read the doc](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/user/errors_during_fetching.html#creationupdate-of-a-site-configuration-file) to learn how improving these files.

## Thank you

When I started wallabag, I never thought that it would be so popular. Ten years after, you are still here ‚ù§Ô∏è. And the project is still alive thanks to the team: thank you guys!

You can follow us on [Mastodon](https://social.tcit.fr/@wallabag) to have some news. You can also help the team by [donating on Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/wallabag/).

Thank you for your support ‚ù§Ô∏è

Nicolas
