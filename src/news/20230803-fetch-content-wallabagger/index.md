Today, we want to promote a great feature of [wallabagger](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabagger), our browser addon (available on Firefox ‚ù§Ô∏è, Chrome or Opera).

This new feature was implemented few weeks ago and it allows you to fetch content from the browser by default: you can say goodbye to paywalls üéâ!

Our beloved @kdecherf wrote a blog post to tell you how using it perfectly.

You can read it on his blog: [Fetch content from browser on-demand with wallabagger](https://kdecherf.com/blog/2023/08/02/fetch-content-from-browser-on-demand-with-wallabagger/).

There is also a french version: [R√©cup√©rer un article depuis le navigateur avec wallabagger](https://kdecherf.com/blog/2023/08/02/recuperer-un-article-depuis-le-navigateur-avec-wallabagger/).

Thank you so much to the wallabagger team, specially [@majso who implemented this feature](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabagger/pull/343) and thank you Kevin for the blog posts!
