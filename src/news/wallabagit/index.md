It's a great moment for me. When I started wallabag on April 2013, it was just a personal project. Today, you're [more than 11.000](https://framabag.org/analytics/) on framabag.org. And you are many to install it on your own web server.

Because installing wallabag can be more and more difficult, [I launched wallabag.it](https://www.wallabag.it/), a service to use the last version of wallabag. No need to install and upgrade wallabag, we do it for you.

For only €9 per year, you have the latest version of wallabag, a professional support and many other features. Hurry up: on March 2017, the subscription will be €12.
I hope you won't encounter problems with [wallabag.it](http://https///www.wallabag.it), but we can't still have some bugs: [send me an email if you have problems](mailto:nicolas@wallabag.it).

If you are an enterprise and you want to have specific developments for your wallabag instance, [please contact me](mailto:nicolas@wallabag.it).

Have a nice day and [see you soon on wallabag.it](https://www.wallabag.it/)!
