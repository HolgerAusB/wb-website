**First of all, we wish you a happy new year.**

Let's take a look back. 2016 was a great year for our team:
* our project was 3 years old.
* [we released wallabag 2.0](http://www.wallabag.org/en/news/wallabag-v2)
* [we talked about wallabag at PHP Tour](http://nicolas.loeuillet.org/billets/phptour-2016-clermont) (french article), a french conference about PHP.
* [we released a new iOS application](https://appsto.re/fr/YeqYfb.i)
* [we released wallabag 2.1](http://www.wallabag.org/en/news/wallabag-21)
* we released a new addon for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wallabagger/gbmgphmejlcoihgedabhgjdkcahacjlj), also compatible with [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wallabagger/) and [Opera](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wallabagger/). [More details in this blog post](http://www.wallabag.org/en/news/wallabagger-howto).
* [we launched wallabag.it](http://www.wallabag.org/en/news/wallabagit), a quality service for using wallabag. For only ‚Ç¨12 per year, you'll get a quality hosting, a professional support, automatic upgrades and daily backups.

[We had a roadmap for the last year](http://www.wallabag.org/en/news/wallabag-public-beta1). One missing thing: wallabag 2.2. We failed to release it on 2016: it's only because this release will be huge and we still have some work to do on. [You can have a look on the changelog of this version here](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/pull/2416).
Stay tuned, wallabag 2.2 will be available in coming weeks.

We don't have yet a roadmap for this new year, but we're sure this year will be awesome, like the previous ones.
As you can see, [we worked on a new website](https://www.wallabag.org). More professional, easier to find information, more beautiful: we hope you like it. We now have an english and a french website (german translation will be available in coming days).If you find some bugs on this new website, [contact us](mailto:hello@wallabag.org).

I want to thank you here our great team, specially Thomas and Jeremy (core team), Julian (Windows application) , Dmitriy and Strubbl (Android application), Yuriy and Simon (browsers addon), xsteadfastx (Docker image) and [all of our contributors](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/graphs/contributors).
We ‚ù§Ô∏è &nbsp;you!

Let's go for this new year üéâ !
