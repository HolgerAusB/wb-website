Here is the latest release of wallabag.
What changed?

It's a maintenance release, no big changes inside that release. It's mostly to catch up after almost a year without one release. 

- Site-configs were almost a year behind (17 versions behind exactly).
- A lot of JS package were totally outdated (yes jQuery is still outdated...).
- Also **wallabag is now compatible with PHP 8.0 & 8.1** !

To update your instance, [just run `make update`.](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/admin/upgrade.html#upgrading-from-23x-to-23y)
