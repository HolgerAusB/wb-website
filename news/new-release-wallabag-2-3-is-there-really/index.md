## Whatâ€™s new?

### Sites with paywall

In wallabag 2.2, we added the availability to save articles on websites who an authentication is required. It was a little bit tricky to configure, because you needed to edit files.

**But our so great @j0k3r created an interface to easily handle your credentials**. 

![](credentials.png)

In Site credentials, you need to create a new credential by typing the domain name (without the https://www. part â€“ we'll improve it soon), your username and your login. All is encrypted in your database. If you want more details, [you can read the specifications here](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/pull/2683). 

Today, you can save articles from NextInpact.com, ArretSurImages.net, Mediapart.fr, Monde-diplomatique.fr, CourrierInternational.com and in coming days, Alternatives-Economiques.fr, Telegraph.co.uk, LeFigaro.fr and LeMonde.fr will be available. If you want to add new websites, please contact us.

### Other features

* you can now remove all your archived entries by one click (on the config screen)
* we store publication date and author of each article if our system can detect them
* we added a notmaches operator for the automatic tagging rules (available on the config screen)
* there is a confirmation when you want to delete an article to avoid mistake
* we added tags on the list view
* thanks to the filters, you can now retrieve easily the articles which were shared publicly. We also improve the public view of the articles.
* we added RSS for tags and for all entries
* Ð¶ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹! wallabag speaks Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º!
* you can now store the origin URL of an article (for example, the tweet where you found the link) by editing the article (click on the pencil on the article view).
