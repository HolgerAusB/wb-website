‚ö†Ô∏è **We had issues with our update process in 2.6.0 release: this release fixes one of them. Be careful, it may possible that we have other unknown issues. Please do backups.**

If you have issue with this issue `You have requested a non-existent service "scheb_two_factor.security.google_authenticator".`, [please read this message](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/6649#issuecomment-1600262599). 

‚ö†Ô∏è **There are two points to focus for that update**:

1. We added new fields in the database, don't forget to run migration (by running `make update`) otherwise your wallabag won't work.
2. We've updated the mailer config which needs to be replicated otherwise it might not work.

   We removed in `app/config/parameters.yml`:
   - `mailer_transport`
   - `mailer_user`
   - `mailer_password`
   - `mailer_host`
   - `mailer_port`
   - `mailer_encryption`
   - `mailer_auth_mode`

   And we added `mailer_dsn` as a replacement. Here is [an example of DSN](https://symfony.com/doc/4.4/mailer.html#using-built-in-transports): `smtp://user:pass@smtp.example.com:port`
