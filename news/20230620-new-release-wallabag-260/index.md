wallabag ü¶òturns 10 üéÇ ! To celebrate this birthday, we are pleased to announce the release of [wallabag 2.6.0](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/releases/tag/2.6.0).

We developed this release during a year and I want to thank [each of the contributors](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/releases/tag/2.6.0).

I hope you will love the new features and the fixes we made.

## Have a look on some new features

wallabag is 10: it's starting to get a little rusty. That's why we made a lot of effort to improve technical stuff, under the hood.
Most of this work was done by [Yassine](https://github.com/yguedidi): thank you so much! Thanks to him, wallabag can go forward (for the next 10 years?).
